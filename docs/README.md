RFP response email: Send after receiving RFP
Hi ${first name},

I am honored that Liferay has been selected to respond for ${Company}’s business through an RFP. We look forward to showing ${Company} and the whole evaluation team why Liferay would be a strategic solution to address the current and future challenges that ${Company} is facing in their RFP process.

Based on the current status in the request, I will show how Liferay will help to: create a more consistent process across international regions, save individuals time to focus on other initiatives, and provide insights into all RFP analytics across your organization.

I will follow up within the next week with any questions we have about the RFP.

Thanks again for the opportunity!

Hi ${first name},

It is apparent that ${names} spent a lot of time putting this request together. Thanks for sending us such an organized RFP outline…they aren’t always delivered this way!

At this time we are still reviewing, and the requirements are aligning well with Liferay’s offerings. We have outlined a few comments and questions. We would like to schedule a one-hour review session with your team to cover everything.

Is your team available at ${Date-and-Time} for this review session? Please confirm and I’ll send over a calendar invite.

Thanks and talk soon!
Konnor
